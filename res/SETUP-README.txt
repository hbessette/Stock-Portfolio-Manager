The jar file must be in the same directory as a folder named "StockData", and another folder
named "StockPortfolios".

===================

The jar should work in exactly the way the assignment description states:
running it with -text at the end will open the text version, and no arguments will open the GUI.

===================

The program should support all stocks with Symbols that Alpha Vantage has access to,
but it was tested on GOOG, AAPL, and MSFT.

The program should support all dates on which stock data is available (not weekends).
